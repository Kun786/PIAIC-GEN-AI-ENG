# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based application to track and manage student grades. It calculates individual averages, checks pass/fail status, and computes the overall class average using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Features:
- Add student names and their scores in three subjects (Math, Science, English).
- Calculate individual student averages.
- Determine if a student is passing (based on a minimum score of 40 in each subject).
- Calculate the class average.
- Display individual performance and the class average.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository or download the project file.
2. Run the Python script `student_performance_tracker.py` in any Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to enter student data.
4. Type `done` when finished to view the performance summary.

## Files:
- `student_performance_tracker.py`: Python script containing the main project code.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Student_Performance_Tracker.git


### Example and Usage.
   Enter student details:
Name (or type 'done' to finish): Alice
Enter Math score: 85
Enter Science score: 90
Enter English score: 80

Name (or type 'done' to finish): Bob
Enter Math score: 40
Enter Science score: 35
Enter English score: 50

Student Performance:
------------------------------
Name: Alice, Average Score: 85.00, Status: Passing
Name: Bob, Average Score: 41.67, Status: Failing
------------------------------
